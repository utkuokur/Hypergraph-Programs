This package contains Sagemath code to calculate:

1- the list of Veblen hypergraphs on d edges and less than or equal to n vertices, of rank k.

2- the associated coefficient of a Veblen hypergraph

3- the characteristic polynomial of a simple hypergraph via resultants

4- the characteristic polynomial of a simple hypergraph with edge-variables

5- the first few coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a hypergraph for larger hypergraphs via Harary Sachs Theorem

6 - the lagrange polynomials of the hypergraphs described in the paper "A Family of Nonreconstructible Hypergraphs" by W. L. Kocay. 

7- calculates the hyperdeterminant of a cubical hypermatrix via the algorithm in "Using Algebraic Geometry" by Cox-Little-Oâ€™Shea. 

The main file contains the first three functions just mentioned. In addition, there are some other files, designed for specific use cases. 

These and related concepts are described in the paper:

Abstract: We generalize the Harary-Sachs theorem to k-uniform hypergraphs: the codegree-d coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of a uniform hypergraph H can be expressed as a weighted sum of subgraph counts over certain multi-hypergraphs with d edges. We include a detailed description of the aforementioned multi-hypergraphs and a formula for their corresponding weights.

Relevant Definitions: 

1- A Veblen hypergraph of rank k is a hypergraph of rank k such that the degree of each vertex is divisible by k. Given k, n and d, we can calculate the list of all possibly disconnected Veblen hypergraphs on d edges and less than or equal to n vertices, of rank k, using the first program.

2- The associated coefficient of a Veblen hypergraph H is the rational number obtained by summing, over all rootings R of H, the ratio of the number of Eulerian circuits of D_R, the digraph obtained from R, over the product of the in-degrees of the vertices of D_R. 

3- The characteristic polynomial of a simple hypergraph H is polynomial in the variable x obtained by taking the resultant of I-xA, where A is the adjacency hypermatrix of H.

4- Let H be a simple hypergraph on n vertices, with rank k. Let e_{i_1 ... i_k} be formal variables for each k-set {i_1 ... i_k}. 
The characteristic polynomial with edge-variables (or the weighted characteristic polynomial) of H is the resultant of I-xA, where A is the adjacency hypermatrix of H with edge-variables: The (i_1 ... i_k) entry is e_{i_1 ... i_k}/(k-1)! where e_{i_1 ... i_k} is a formal variable. Substituting e_{i_1 ... i_k} = 1 for each edge-variable recovers the characteristic polynomial of H.

5- When the hypergraph is large, we can still calculate the first few coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, using the Harary-Sachs Theorem. 

6- Hypomorphic hypergraphs are those with the same vertex deck, as described in the paper "A Family of Nonreconstructible Hypergraphs" by W. L. Kocay.

Examples:

1- In Example 1, we calculate the list of all Veblen hypergraphs on 6 edges and less than or equal to 5 vertices, of rank 3. 

2- In Example 2, we calculate the associated coefficient of the Veblen hypergraph with edge set { [0,1,2], [0,1,2], [0,1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3] }. 

3- In Example 3, we calculate the characteristic polynomial of the hypergraph with edge set { [0,1,2], [0,1,3], [0,2,3], [1,2,3] } (the complete hypergraph of rank 3 on 4 vertices). There is an option to estimate the remaining time. 

4- In Example 4, we calculate the characteristic polynomial with edge-variables of the hypergraph with edge set { [0,1,2], [1,2,3] }.

5- In Example 5, we calculate the first 9 coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of two hypomorphic but not isomorphic hypergraphs. 

6- In Example 6, we calculate the Lagrange polynomial of the hypomorphic but not isomorphic hypergraphs given in the paper "A Family of Nonreconstructible Hypergraphs" by W. L. Kocay. 

The code is written in Sagemath 10.1, which is available in WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) in Windows 11. Some of the programs require Macaulay 2, a software system for algebraic geometry.
